This repository contains a README.md file, a Homework folder containing a copy of my homework 1, and a Labs folder containing a copy of my work from lab 1.

The README.md file provides information about what this respository is. This is very important for any repository.

The Homework folder contains my work from homework 1. This is very important because I will be graded on it.

The Labs folder contains my work from Lab 1 last week. This is pretty disorganized because I was just getting the hang of how to do things.

In conclusion, this repository exercise is helpful and I hope this is 500 characters.
